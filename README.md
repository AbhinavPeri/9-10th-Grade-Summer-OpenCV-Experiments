# 9-10th-Grade-Summer-OpenCV-Experiments

This repo is a very broad set of experiments I ran during the COVID summer with OpenCV and computer vision. I apologize for the lack of runner files (I wasn't a great coder back then).

Experiments include
- Visual Odometry (Not working)
- Homography (Working)
- 3D camera visualizer with Projection Matrix (Working)
- Unsupervised classification with PCA and Gabor Filters (Not working)
- Camera Calibration util (Working)

There are probably more in here, but I just forgot because it's been a while
